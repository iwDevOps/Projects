üëã Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.
My name is Phillip Cardenas, and I am a passionate DevOps and Cloud Engineer focused on building efficient, scalable, and reliable infrastructure. I specialize in automating software delivery pipelines, managing infrastructure as code, and orchestrating containerized applications.

This repository serves as a central hub for my key projects. Each project is designed to demonstrate a specific set of my skills in modern DevOps practices. 

üöÄ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on. Each one has its own repository with detailed documentation explaining its architecture and how to run it.

1. Automated CI/CD Pipeline for a Web App
This project demonstrates a complete, automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. On every push to the main branch, the application is automatically built, tested, containerized, and deployed to a cloud environment.

What it showcases: CI/CD principles, automation, Docker, and cloud deployment.

Technologies Used: GitHub Actions, Docker, Python (Flask), AWS Elastic Beanstalk

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
This project provisions a secure and scalable cloud network and server infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The code is modular and reusable, defining a custom VPC, subnets, security groups, and an EC2 instance from scratch.

What it showcases: Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud networking, security, and provisioning.

Technologies Used: Terraform, AWS (VPC, EC2, Security Groups)

3. Container Orchestration with Kubernetes
This project involves containerizing a multi-tier application and deploying it to a managed Kubernetes cluster. It includes defining Kubernetes objects like Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps to run and manage the application at scale.

What it showcases: Containerization, microservices architecture, and container orchestration.

Technologies Used: Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon EKS, Helm

4. Full-Stack Monitoring & Observability
This project sets up a complete monitoring and logging stack using the Prometheus and Grafana ecosystem. It collects metrics and logs from a running application, visualizes them in real-time dashboards, and includes a basic alerting setup.

What it showcases: Monitoring, observability, metrics collection, and data visualization.

Technologies Used: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Docker Compose

5. Microservice Deployment with an API Gateway
This project demonstrates the deployment of a URL shortener application built with a microservice architecture. It uses an Ingress Controller (API Gateway) to manage external traffic and route requests to the appropriate backend services running in a Kubernetes cluster.

What it showcases: Microservice patterns, API gateways, and advanced Kubernetes deployments.

Technologies Used: Kubernetes, Docker, NGINX Ingress, Node.js, Redis
